# Jarvis
> An asistant for automating your molecular dynamics simulations: "Jarvis", initially created by Iron Man


## Installation

Linux:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Chenghao-Wu/Jarvis.git
sh dependence.sh # install the dependent packages
```

## Usage example

The test_automation.py shows one basic working example of molecular dynamics simulation using [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov) for calculating thermal conductivity of polymeric systems. It also provides the plugin of [moltemplate](https://www.moltemplate.org) for creating initial configuration in the format of [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov).


## Development setup

The test of this package is still unfinished since it is still in intensive developement.


## Roadmap

See the open issues for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
