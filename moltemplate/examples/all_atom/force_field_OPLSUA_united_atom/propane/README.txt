(Thanks!)

This is a simulation of propane using the OPLSUA force-field.
(It uses the OPLSUA force field even though the file names begin with "oplsaa")

IMPORTANT: This is NOT an all-atom simulation.
           OPLSUA is a united-atom force-field.
           Hydrogen atoms are not represented explicitly.
           The force-field has been adjusted accordingly.
