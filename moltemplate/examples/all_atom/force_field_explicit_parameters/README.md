This directory contains a few examples of all-atom simulations
that do *not* use force-fields.
(Specifically, they do not use force-field rules to generate
angle, dihedral, and improper interactions automatically.)
Instead, in these examples, all of the angle, dihedral, and improper
interactions (if any) were expicitly listed in the molecule definition files
(along with the corresponding force field parameters).

*(Note: Listing all the angles and dihedrals in a complex molecule manually
is not feasible.  The examples here that do contain molecules
feature very simple molecules like water.)*
