# This file contains a definition for the "CH2" molecular subunit.
# First, load the COMPASS force field parameters we will need:

import "compass_published.lt" # <-- defines the "COMPASS" force field

# (The "compass_published.lt" file is located in the "force_fields" 
#  subdirectory distributed with moltemplate.)
# Then define "CH2":




CH2 inherits COMPASS {

  # atom-id  mol-id   atom-type  charge   x             y                z

# COMMENTS:
# 1) Atom type names (eg. "c4", "h1") are defined in "compass_published.lt".
# 2) In this example, the atomic charge of an atom is calculated by summing 
#    partial charge contributions from neighboring atoms bonded to this atom.
#    (according to the rules in "compass_published.lt").  For this reason,
#    we can ignore the "charge" column in the "Data Atoms" section.  Just
#    leave theses charges as "0.0" for now. Moltemplate will recalculate them.
# 3) The "..." in "$mol:..." tells moltemplate that this molecule may be part
#    of a larger molecule, and (if so) to use the larger parent object's 
#    molecule id number as it's own.





# Optional: Shift all the coordinates in the +Y direction by 0.4431163.
#           This way, the carbon atom is no longer located at 0,0,0, but the
#           axis of an alkane chain containing this monomer is at 0,0,0.
#           (This makes it more convenient to construct a polymer later.
#            If this is confusing, then simply add 0.4431163 to the Y 
#            coordinates in the "Data Atoms" section above.)
