# which (more or less) uniformly fills the simulation box:

molecules = new Butane [12].move(0, 0, 5.2)

# NOTE: The spacing between molecules is large.  There should be extra room to
# move during the initial stages of equilibration.  However, you will have to
# run the simulation at NPT conditions later to compress the system to a 
# more realistic density.
