This directory contains examples of coarse-grained double-stranded DNA models.

None of the DNA polymers in this directory (or its subdirectories) can be
separated into individual strands.  If you want to simulate single-stranded DNA,
DNA melting, bubles, junctions, or anything else that requires modeling the
interaction between bases (in DNA or RNA), then look outside this directory.

(Note: At some point, some of the examples in this directory may include both
 DNA and RNA.  If so, any examples also containing RNA, either single or
 double-stranded, will be simple Kratky-Porod-like models only.)
