# This file defines a cylindrical wall whose diameter is approximately
# consistent with the width of a Caulobacter crescentus cell.
#
# NOTE: The length of the cylinder we are using here is extremely long.
#       (In LAMMPS, there is no way to make it infinite.)  However this
#       does not matter because we are using periodic boundary conditions
#       in this simulation. Only the length of the simulation box matters.
#       During the simulation, the box length will be adjusted until it
#       equals the length of a typical Caulobacter crescentus cell.

# This sets the parameter "rc0" equal to 330.0.
# The rc0 parameter is not the radius of the cylinder.  It is slightly larger to
# make room for a thin region of space where the force field will push inward.
# Setting rc0=330.0 means we assume no particle will ever travel further than
# 330.0 from the central axis of the cylinder.
# Particles will experience an inward pushing force earlier than this.
# The exact value of the rc0 parameter does not matter very much as long as
# it is big enough to enclose the cylinder and some additional wiggle room.
# For details, see: http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/region.html






# Now apply an inward force applied to every particle which lies outside
# a spherical region (of radius rc0-rc)
# The energy of each particle (due to that force) is:
