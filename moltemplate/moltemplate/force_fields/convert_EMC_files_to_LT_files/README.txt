This directory contains a tool "emcprm2lt.py" which
converts ".PRM" files containing lists of force-field parameters
in EMC format into MOLTEMPLATE files in ".LT" format.
(Several force fields including MARTINI and SDK have been
 converted into moltemplate format using this tool.)

---- Credit: ----

The "emcprm2lt.py" converter was writtin by David Stelter.
The .PRM files we use were written by Pieter J. in 't Veld.

Since we borrowed force field parameters from files distributed with EMC,
if you use files generated by "emcprm2lt.py", please also cite the EMC paper:
