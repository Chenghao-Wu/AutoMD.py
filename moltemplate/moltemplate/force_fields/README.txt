If moltemplate is unable to locate an .LT file that the user has requested
(ie. using the "import" command) in the current local directory,
moltemplate will search for that file here.

This directory contains moltemplate files (.LT files) containing common
force fields (including parameters and rules for creating bonded interactions),
as well as definitions of molecules which are frequently used (for example
SPCE water).

The scripts used to convert these force fields are located here as well, along
with the original files containing the force field parameters (when available).
