  # rules in loplsaa.lt), and can be omitted. Just leave them as "0.00" for now.
  # The "..." in "$mol:..." tells moltemplate that this molecule may be part
  # of a larger molecule, and (if so) to use the larger parent object's 
  # molecule id number as it's own.

# Optional: Shift all the coordinates in the +Y direction by 0.4431163.
#           This way, the carbon atom is no longer located at 0,0,0, but the
#           axis of an alkane chain containing this monomer is at 0,0,0.
#           (This makes it more convenient to construct a polymer later.
#            If this is confusing, then simply add 0.4431163 to the Y 
#            coordinates in the "Data Atoms" section above.)
