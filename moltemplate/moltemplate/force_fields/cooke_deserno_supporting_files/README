---Cooke Deserno coarse-grained bilayer model---

This folder contains an lt file for a Cooke-type 3-bead lipid, as described in:

"Tunable generic model for fluid bilayer membranes"
 Cooke IR, Kremer K, Deserno M, Physical Review E, 2005

Due to the form of the forcefield, this requires a 'tabulated potential' style in lammps. This is easily generated using the included python script. Usage as follows:

  gen_potential-cooke.py w_c

where w_c is an optional parameter as described in the original paper (10.1103/PhysRevE.72.011506) with default value of 1.6

This creates the 'tabulated_potential' file which is needed by lammps during the simulation.
