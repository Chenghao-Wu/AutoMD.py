# Monomer Bank
polymer monomer structures for building atomistic polymer systems using Moltemplate and Jarvis.

## Installation

Linux:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Chenghao-Wu/Monomer-Database.git
```

## Roadmap

Now it supports for building 
1. atomistic polyethylene 
1. atomistic polypropylene
4. atomistic poly(acrylic acid) Na+ electrolyte
5. atomistic polystyrene
2. united polyethylene 
3. united polypropylene


See the open issues for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
* need to add functionality of atactic configurations.
